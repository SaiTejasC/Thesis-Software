#logic of the code:
#prev = previous image
#prevPatterns = identify the coords of the patterns in the previous image
# - probabbly where you check illuminnace of patterns if its >50
#curr = current image
#identify coord of the patterns in the current image
# - also probabbly where you check illuminnace of the patterns if its >50
#check how much the patterns moved
#magic function that checks how much the pattern moved
